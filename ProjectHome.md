This distribution of robocode implements the idea of using different fighting techniques when the robot is trying to deal with various fighting techniques in order to handle both long-range and short-range attacks.

Once attack from opponent is determined as long-range attack, this robot uses more turns on evading than attacking to prevent opponent who is also moving along. Once a bullet hit the opponent, this robot gradually increase the gun power, this speeds up the killing process when it is facing robots such as SittingDuck or Corners. When a bullet is missed, this robot simply resets back the gun power.

When attack is determined as short-range attack, this robot focuses on aiming and attacking more than evading. This is to prevent one of the famous fighting techniques, ramming. At this moment, this robot is also using the max power toward its opponent.

This robot might not be the best robot yet, there are still lots of room to get it improved. Please stay tuned for the next major release!
